The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\r\n\t * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\r\n\t * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\r\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\r\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods.
